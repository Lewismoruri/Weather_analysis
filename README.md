Weather Analysis Data Engineering Project 🌦️
📌 Overview

This project is a data engineering pipeline for weather analysis.
It demonstrates how to collect, clean, and analyze weather data to uncover useful insights such as temperature trends, rainfall patterns, and forecast predictions.

The project focuses on applying data engineering concepts including:

Data extraction from APIs

Data transformation & cleaning

Data loading & storage

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualization for insights

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python (data processing & analysis)

Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)

Matplotlib (visualization)

OpenWeather API (data source)

Jupyter Notebook (experimentation)

Git/GitHub (version control)

📊 Project Workflow

Data Collection

Fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API.

Data Transformation

Clean raw JSON responses.

Convert into structured tabular format.

Handle missing values & unit conversions.

Data Storage

Store processed data in CSV files for reproducibility.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify weather trends (temperature, humidity, rainfall).

Generate summary statistics.

Visualize trends using line plots and bar charts.

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-analysis-data-engineering.git
cd weather-analysis-data-engineering


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Add your OpenWeather API key in the script (config.py or directly in the notebook).

Run the analysis:

jupyter notebook weather_analysis.ipynb

📈 Example Insights

Average temperature trends over time.

Comparison of daily highs and lows.

Rainfall distribution analysis.

🔮 Future Improvements

Automating data collection with Airflow or Prefect.

Storing data in a SQL database instead of CSV.

Building dashboards with Power BI or Tableau.
